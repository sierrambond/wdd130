    <p>Hello! I am from Kansas City, Missouri. I am in my 7th semester/junior year. I am studying accounting and doing a tax internship this semester. I am the oldest of three kids. My sister is in her second semester at BYUI this winter and my brother is a junior in high school. Something I like to do in my free time is play board games.</p> 
    <p>I see lots of value in this class because I might open my own accounting firm one day and I could make my own website with the knowledge I learn from this class. I'm super excited to learn html and css and see my work come to fruition.</p>
