      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to make an informational website about common houseplants, how to care for them, and their benefits. I want everybody to come to enjoy their plants as much as I do mine.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience would be for people like myself who enjoy caring for plants but would like to learn how to better care for them or see if they are beneficial to us (or if they're poisonous to animals).</p>  <!-- change this -->

        On this page we will talk about the most common houseplants that I've seen. I'm in a few Facebook plant groups, so I'm always seeing new varieties. The people in these groups are super knowledgeable and take good care of their plants. These pages are where I got most of my plant knowledge. I would like this website to be a collection of all that I’ve learned from the groups to be placed in one spot. I hope to encourage others to get houseplants because they bring me joy and I wish for others to have that same joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to go to Walmart, Lowe's, or Home Depot and look at the plant section to add plants I see to my wish list. I am going to talk about how to tell which plants are what just by looking at them. Some species are going to be easier to remember the differences than others. We’ll split these into two big sections first: leafy plants and succulents. I will have pictures so I can point out distinct characteristics that make the plant unique.

      <h3>Plant Care</h3>
      <p>
        One very important part of keeping plants alive is to know what kind of care they need! Everyone, no matter their green thumb status, can grow houseplants! You just need to be matched to the right plant based on the care you want to give. Lots of people get succulents because they look cute or are trendy to get, and then they think they need to water it more than is necessary. This causes the plant to die. If you’re looking to water something more often, it would be a safer bet to get a plant that has well-draining soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some plants like to keep it humid and keep their soil moist which requires a different type of soil than a lot of other plants. Most other plants I’ve seen need well-draining soil. The type of soil could be life or death to the plant so beware of its needs. Many of the plants on the Facebook groups I’m in are rooted in water bases. Some are just straight up put in water, and some are planted in a leca and water combination. Leca is a substitute for soil made with small clay pebbles which help retain moisture.

      </ul>
      <h3>Propagation</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to the plant life cycle, propagation is one way to have a new beginning. Propagation is when you take an existing part of your plant and allow it to grow into a new baby plant. When this is done with succulents, you typically see leaves being taken off the bottom of the mother plant and then set aside in their grow area/tray to allow for roots to grow. Another way to do this is taking the leaves and/or stems of certain plants and sticking it in water to allow for root growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lots of plants, like the common pothos plants, have nodes which are where the roots come out. So, when propagating pothos plants, you should cut in between the nodes. My mother has had a pothos plant for about 3 years and because they are vining plants, the stem gets super long. To keep up with maintenance, she would give the plant a trim but also get a new plant out of that trim. Whenever I have tried to propagate succulents in the past, I have not been at all successful. However, my grandma has been very successful in propagating African Violets. I will be giving a step by step with pictures on how to propagate like my grandma does. She started with one plant she bought years and years ago but now her kitchen is filled with her propagation station consisting with a majority of African Violets.
